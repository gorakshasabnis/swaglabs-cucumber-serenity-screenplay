# Swag Labs - Cucumber Serenity BDD Starter project:

The screenplay pattern is an actor-centric model. We call a user interacting with the system an Actor. Tests describe how a user interacts with the application to achieve a goal. For this reason, tests read much better if they are presented from the point of view of the user (rather than from the point of ‘pages’).

This is a simple example of using Serenity BDD screenplay pattern with Cucumber 6 on [Swag Labs](https://www.saucedemo.com/).
